Rank memes by their originality. Evaluate how fresh, inventive, and creative each meme feels compared to the others. Consider whether the meme introduces a surprising visual choice, an unconventional format, a clever structural twist, or an unexpected use of a familiar template. A meme that feels like a new discovery should be ranked higher than one that rehashes a joke or format that has already been widely circulated, because originality is what captures attention in a saturated content landscape.
