The internet is drowning in memes. Every day, millions of images, videos, and text posts flood social feeds, each one competing for a moment of attention. Most of them wash over us without leaving a trace. They borrow the same templates, retell the same jokes, and lean on the same familiar rhythms that stopped being surprising long ago. But every once in a while, a meme stops you mid-scroll. It catches you off guard. It feels like something you have never quite seen before, even if you have spent years steeped in internet culture. That feeling — the spark of encountering something genuinely new — is originality, and it is the quality that rank-memes-by-originality is designed to detect and measure.

The purpose of this function is to take a collection of memes and arrange them from most original to least original, producing a ranking that reflects how fresh, inventive, and surprising each meme feels relative to the others in the set. The input is straightforward: a group of memes, each one a self-contained piece of internet humor or commentary. The function evaluates every meme against the others and returns an ordering, a spectrum from the most strikingly original down to the most derivative. It does not ask whether a meme is funny, popular, or well-crafted in a general sense. It asks one pointed question: does this meme feel like a new discovery, or does it feel like something the internet has already seen a thousand times?

This kind of ranking has real value in a content landscape that is deeply saturated. Curators who manage meme accounts or community feeds need a way to surface content that will actually capture attention, and originality is one of the strongest predictors of stopping power. Researchers studying the evolution of internet culture need tools to distinguish genuine creative breakthroughs from the endless tide of repetition. Content platforms looking to reward creators benefit from identifying who is pushing boundaries rather than who is most efficiently recycling what already works. In all of these cases, the function serves as a lens that filters for the new amidst the noise.

To rank memes by originality in a meaningful way, three core qualities must be evaluated. Each one captures a different dimension of what makes something feel fresh, and together they form a complete picture of originality.

The first quality is conceptual novelty. This is the most fundamental layer of originality: the idea itself. A meme with high conceptual novelty introduces a joke, observation, or point of view that feels genuinely unfamiliar. It is not simply restating a widely known truth or recycling a punchline that has already made its rounds across every platform. It offers a perspective or connection that the viewer has not encountered before, or at least not in this particular form. A meme that pairs two ideas nobody thought to combine, or that finds humor in a corner of human experience that has gone largely uncommented on, scores high in conceptual novelty. A meme that tells essentially the same joke as ten thousand others before it, no matter how cleanly executed, does not. This quality asks: is the underlying thought behind this meme something new?

The second quality is structural inventiveness. Even when the core idea of a meme is fresh, the way it is constructed matters enormously. Structural inventiveness measures how creatively a meme uses its format, template, visual layout, or medium. A meme that takes a well-known template and uses it exactly as intended, filling in the blanks the way everyone else does, shows low structural inventiveness. But a meme that subverts a familiar template, repurposes it in an unexpected context, layers formats on top of one another, or abandons conventional meme structures entirely in favor of something new demonstrates real creative ambition in its construction. This quality also captures visual originality — an unusual image choice, an unexpected pairing of text and picture, or a layout that breaks the norms of how memes are typically assembled. Structural inventiveness asks: does this meme do something surprising with the way it is built?

The third quality is surprise. Originality, at its core, is inseparable from the experience of being caught off guard. Surprise measures the degree to which a meme defies the viewer's expectations — not just in its punchline, but in its entirety. A meme with high surprise takes the viewer somewhere they did not anticipate. It might set up a familiar pattern and then break it. It might deliver its meaning through an unexpected mechanism, like a visual punchline where the viewer expected text, or a layer of irony where sincerity was assumed. Surprise is what separates a meme that a viewer could have predicted from one that genuinely rewrites their expectations. This quality is relational: it depends on what the viewer has already been exposed to, which is why the function ranks memes against one another rather than scoring them in isolation. In a set where most memes follow predictable patterns, even a modest twist can register as surprising. In a set full of experimental content, only the most daring departures rise to the top. Surprise asks: does this meme take the viewer somewhere they did not expect to go?

These three qualities — conceptual novelty, structural inventiveness, and surprise — work together to form a comprehensive understanding of originality. A meme might have a novel concept but present it in a completely standard format, which limits its originality. Another might be structurally wild but built on a joke everyone has already heard, which undercuts its freshness. The most original memes tend to score highly across all three dimensions: they offer a new idea, present it in an unexpected way, and deliver an experience that the viewer could not have predicted. By evaluating each of these qualities and weighing them against the rest of the set, rank-memes-by-originality produces a ranking that reflects not just surface-level novelty, but a deep and layered understanding of what it means to create something genuinely new in a medium defined by repetition and remix.

Originality matters because it is the engine of cultural evolution. Every meme format that now feels tired and overused was once a flash of brilliance that caught the internet by surprise. By building a tool that can identify and elevate that flash, we create a way to honor and encourage the creative risk-taking that keeps internet culture alive. The function does not punish familiarity for its own sake — it simply recognizes that in a world overflowing with content, the things most worth paying attention to are the things we have never seen before.
