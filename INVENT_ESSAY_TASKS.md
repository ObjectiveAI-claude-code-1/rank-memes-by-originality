1. Evaluate conceptual novelty by examining whether the meme introduces a genuinely unfamiliar idea, joke, observation, or point of view. Determine if the underlying thought offers a perspective or connection the viewer has not encountered before — such as pairing two ideas nobody thought to combine, or finding humor in an uncommented-on corner of human experience — as opposed to restating a widely known truth or recycling a punchline that has already made its rounds. A meme built on a fresh concept should be ranked higher than one that retells the same joke as thousands before it, regardless of how cleanly it is executed.

2. Evaluate structural inventiveness by examining how creatively the meme uses its format, template, visual layout, and medium. Determine whether the meme subverts a familiar template, repurposes it in an unexpected context, layers formats on top of one another, or abandons conventional meme structures entirely in favor of something new. Consider visual originality as well — unusual image choices, unexpected pairings of text and picture, or layouts that break the norms of typical meme construction. A meme that does something surprising with the way it is built should be ranked higher than one that fills in the blanks of a well-known template exactly the way everyone else does.

3. Evaluate surprise by examining the degree to which the meme defies the viewer's expectations across its entirety — not just in the punchline, but in its setup, delivery mechanism, and overall arc. Determine whether the meme takes the viewer somewhere they did not anticipate, such as setting up a familiar pattern and then breaking it, delivering meaning through an unexpected mechanism like a visual punchline where text was expected, or layering irony where sincerity was assumed. A meme that rewrites the viewer's expectations should be ranked higher than one whose outcome could have been predicted before the viewer finished looking at it.
